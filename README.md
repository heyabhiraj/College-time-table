# College Timetable Generator using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a genetic algorithm to generate a college timetable. The timetable is generated in such a way that it optimizes the allocation of rooms, timeslots, and teachers to different courses, ensuring that the constraints such as room capacity are met.

## Features

- Genetic Algorithm to optimize timetable generation
- Allocates rooms, timeslots, and teachers to courses
- Considers room capacities and total number of students in each course
- Configurable population size, number of generations, and mutation rate

## Prerequisites

- PHP
